# Airbnb Data Cleansing Project

This project demonstrates basic data cleansing techniques using an open-source Airbnb dataset. The goal is to prepare the data for future analysis by handling missing values, standardizing formats, and identifying any inconsistencies.

## Overview

This project includes:
- Exploratory inspection of the dataset
- Cleaning and transformation of raw data
- Exporting a clean version of the dataset for analysis

## Key Actions
- Removed or imputed missing values
- Converted columns to appropriate data types
- Dropped duplicates and invalid entries

## Tools Used
- Python (pandas, numpy)
- Jupyter Notebook

## File Structure

notebooks/         # Jupyter notebook showing the data cleansing process
